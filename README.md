# React Weather Block

This is an experimental decoupled module for Drupal that I am developing as a learning experience. Not intended for use in the real world.

- Node.js 13.10.x or higher
- npm 6.14.x or higher
  **Get Node.js and npm: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm**

## Installation

- Download the module to the `modules/custom` folder of your Drupal region
- On the command line, cd into `react_weather_block`
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm dev` to build your app for production
- In your Drupal _admin > block > structure_, place the **React Weather Block** into a theme region
